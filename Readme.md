# Bookracy Convertor

A powerful EPUB to PDF converter that processes EPUB files and converts them into high-quality, readable PDFs using `jsPDF`. This package is especially useful for anyone looking to convert EPUB files programmatically within their JavaScript/TypeScript projects.

## Features

- Converts EPUB files to PDF format.
- Handles images, styles, and text formatting.
- Preserves the Table of Contents without splitting across pages.
- Lightweight and fast, built on modern JavaScript libraries (`jsPDF`, `JSZip`, `html-to-text`).

## Installation

To use this package, you need to install it via npm:

```bash
npm install bookracy-convertor
```

## Usage

You can import the `buildPDFConvertor` function and pass the URL of the EPUB file along with a button element. The PDF will be generated when the button is clicked.

### Example:

```javascript
import { buildPDFConvertor } from 'bookracy-convertor';

// Get the button and the EPUB URL
const button = document.getElementById('generate-pdf');
const bookUrl = 'https://example.com/path/to/book.epub';

// Initialize the convertor
buildPDFConvertor(bookUrl, button);
```

### Parameters

- `bookUrl` (string): The URL of the EPUB file to convert.
- `button` (HTMLElement): The button element that will trigger the conversion on click.

When the button is clicked, the PDF will be generated and automatically downloaded.

## Requirements

- Node.js v14 or later.
- Browser environment with DOM manipulation (works with most modern browsers).
  
## Testing the Project

### Development Setup

First, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bookracy-convertor.git
cd bookracy-convertor
npm install
```

### Run in Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a Vite development server to preview and test your changes.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This will compile and bundle the code for production use.

### Run ESLint

Make sure to keep the code linted and formatted:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix  # Automatically fix issues
```

### Testing

You can test the conversion function by simulating the button click event in a browser.

1. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.
2. Access the browser and test the button that triggers the conversion.
3. You can also test individual parts by inspecting logs, such as EPUB fetching, PDF generation, etc.

For formal tests (unit tests, etc.), Jest or Mocha can be integrated into the project. (Note: Tests are not included in this version but can be added in the future.)

### How to Test

In addition to the usage and contribution guidelines, here are more detailed testing steps for the project:

#### 1. **Manual Testing in the Browser**
   - **Start Development Server**:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Access the browser, trigger the conversion by clicking the button, and observe the PDF download.

#### 2. **Check Console Logs**:
   - Add `console.log` statements to verify that key processes (e.g., fetching the EPUB, generating PDF pages, handling styles) are working as expected.

#### 3. **Automated Testing (Future Enhancement)**:
   - You can integrate testing frameworks like **Jest** or **Mocha** for unit tests on functions such as `fetchFile`, `handleEpub`, or the PDF creation logic.  
   - Add tests to ensure functions behave correctly for different EPUB files (e.g., with or without Table of Contents, with different image formats, etc.).
